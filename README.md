# Stock Market Prediction Using ML-LSTM Model
 
Stock Market Prediction using LSTM Model. Use Jyputer Notebook .

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models are utilized in stock market prediction due to their ability to capture complex patterns in sequential data. Trained on historical market data, LSTM models learn the relationships between variables and use memory cells to retain information over time. During training, the model adjusts its parameters through backpropagation, improving its predictive capabilities. When applied to new data, LSTM models generate forecasts for future market trends. However, it's important to remember that stock market prediction is challenging and LSTM models are not infallible. They should be used alongside other factors and careful evaluation for effective decision-making.
